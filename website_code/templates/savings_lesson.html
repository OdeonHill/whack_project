        <h2> 
            Types of Savings Accounts
        </h2>
        <p> There are hundreds of savings accounts each with slight differences offered by different banks. But these can be classified into just a few key types </p>

        <h3> Basic Savings Accounts</h3>
        <p> Commonly known as instant access accounts, this is the simplest type of savings account will be offered by nearly all banks. You can move money in and out freely just like any current account. The difference is, you earn interest on any money in the account. </p>

        <p>But what is interest? Interest is simply a percentage of the money in your account that is paid into your account by the bank (on top of what is already) there. Therefore, there is really no cost to keeping as much money as is practical in an instant access savings account and you get interest</p>
