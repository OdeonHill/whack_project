                Phishing 101: Stay Safe Online
            </h1>
            <p class="main-paragraph"> 
                Phishing is a type of online scam where attackers impersonate trusted people or organizations to trick you into revealing sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers, personal data) or into taking an action (clicking a malicious link, opening an attachment). This lesson introduces common phishing tactics, how to spot them, and practical steps to prevent and respond to attacks.

            <h3 class="sub-header"> 
                What Is Phishing?
            </h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph"> 
                At its core, phishing relies on social engineering, manipulating trust and emotions (urgency, fear, curiosity) to get you to act without thinking. Phishing can arrive via email, SMS (smishing), voice calls (vishing), social media messages, or fake websites. Attackers may pretend to be your bank, a colleague, a delivery service, or a tech support agent.

                Common Types of Phishing
            </h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                • Email Phishing: Fraudulent emails that mimic real organizations asking you to click a link or enter credentials. <br>
                • Spear Phishing: Targeted attacks aimed at a specific individual or company, often using personal details to appear legitimate. <br>
                • Smishing: Phishing via SMS text messages that contain malicious links or requests for information. <br>
                • Vishing: Phone calls where attackers pose as support or authorities to extract information. <br>
                • Clone Phishing: A legitimate email is copied and re-sent with a malicious attachment or link swapped in. <br>
                • Credential Harvesting Websites: Fake login pages designed to steal usernames and passwords.

                How to Spot a Phish
            </h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Look for red flags: unexpected messages, urgent language (“act now”), generic greetings (“Dear customer”), spelling or grammar mistakes, suspicious sender addresses (slightly misspelled domains), links that don’t match the displayed text, unexpected attachments, or requests for sensitive information. If something feels off, verify through a different channel (call the company using a known number).

                Preventing Phishing: Best Practices
            </h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                • Think before you click: hover over links (on desktop) to see the real URL. <br>
                • Verify sender identity: independently look up the company’s contact info before responding. <br>
                • Use strong, unique passwords and a password manager to avoid reusing credentials. <br>
                • Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible, it blocks many account takeovers. <br>
